# Description

There is a building of n floors. If an egg drops from the k th floor or above, it will break. If it's dropped from any floor below, it will not break.

You're given two eggs, Find k while minimize the number of drops for the worst case. Return the number of drops in the worst case.

# Solution

- suppose we drop the first egg at kth floor, if it breaks, we only have one egg, so we need to drop from 1 to k - 1 floor
- if it have not break, the problem is we have 2 eggs, and the floor is n - k
- we just want to drop k times, and now we have dropped 1 time, so we only have k - 1 times, next time, we can only add k - 1 floor.(if it breaks, only left k - 2 times to use one egg find k - 1 floors)
- k + (k - 1) + (k - 2) + ... + 1 >= n
- return ceil(sqrt(2 * (double)n + 0.25) - 0.5);

```
