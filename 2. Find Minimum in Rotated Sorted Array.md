# Description

Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).

Find the minimum element.

 Notice

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

# Solution

- if mid > right, means the minimum element is between mid and right (aka, the discontinuous point is in this range)
- else, the the discontinuous point is in [l, mid]
```
class Solution {
public:
    /**
     * @param nums: a rotated sorted array
     * @return: the minimum number in the array
     */
    int findMin(vector<int> &nums) {
        // write your code here
        int l = 0, r = nums.size() - 1;
        while (l + 1 < r) {
            int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] > nums[r])
                l = mid;
            else
                r = mid;
        }
        return min(nums[l], nums[r]);
    }
};
```
