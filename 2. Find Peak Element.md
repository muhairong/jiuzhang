# Description

There is an integer array which has the following features:

The numbers in adjacent positions are different.
A[0] < A[1] && A[A.length - 2] > A[A.length - 1].
We define a position P is a peek if:

A[P] > A[P-1] && A[P] > A[P+1]
Find a peak element in this array. Return the index of the peak.

 Notice

- It's guaranteed the array has at least one peak.
- The array may contain multiple peeks, find any of them.
- The array has at least 3 numbers in it.

# Solution

- check A[mid] and A[mid-1]
```
class Solution {
public:
    /*
     * @param A: An integers array.
     * @return: return any of peek positions.
     */
    int findPeak(vector<int> &A) {
        // write your code here
        int l = 0, r = A.size() - 1;
        while (l + 1 < r) {
            int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
            if (A[mid - 1] > A[mid])
                r = mid;
            else
                l = mid;
        }
        return ((A[l] > A[r])? l : r);
    }
};
```
