# Description

There is a building of n floors. If an egg drops from the k th floor or above, it will break. If it's dropped from any floor below, it will not break.

You're given m eggs, Find k while minimize the number of drops for the worst case. Return the number of drops in the worst case.

# Solution

- dp
- drop 1 egg from kth floor,  F[i][j] = min(1 + max(F[i - 1][k - 1], F[i][j - k]))(1 <= k <= j)
- e.g.  2 eggs, 4 floor (m = 2, n = 4)
  - drop at 1st floor, if breaks, 1 egg and 0 floor, if not, 2 eggs and 3 floor: 1 + max(F[1][0], F[2][3]) = 3
  - drop at 2nd floor, if breaks, 1 egg and 1 floor, if not, 2 eggs and 2 floor: 1 + max(F[1][1], F[2][2]) = 3
  - drop at 3rd floor, if breaks, 1 egg and 2 floor, if not, 2 eggs and 1 floor: 1 + max(F[1][2], F[2][1]) = 3
  - drop at 4th floor, if breaks, 1 egg and 3 floor, if not, 2 eggs and 0 floor: 1 + max(F[1][3], F[2][0]) = 4
  - so, min = 3
