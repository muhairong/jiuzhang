# Description

Given an directed graph, a topological order of the graph nodes is defined as follow:

For each directed edge A -> B in graph, A must before B in the order list.

The first node in the order can be any node in the graph with no nodes direct to it.

Find any topological order for the given graph.

 Notice

You can assume that there is at least one topological order in the graph.

# Solution

- first, put all nodes with input into map S, and count it appearance
- second, use S find nodes without input and put them into queue Q
- third, topo sort
