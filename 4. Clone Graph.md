# Description

Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors.

How we serialize an undirected graph:

Nodes are labeled uniquely.

We use # as a separator for each node, and , as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.

As an example, consider the serialized graph {0,1,2#1,2#2,2}.

The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by #.

First node is labeled as 0. Connect node 0 to both nodes 1 and 2.
Second node is labeled as 1. Connect node 1 to node 2.
Third node is labeled as 2. Connect node 2 to node 2 (itself), thus forming a self-cycle.
Visually, the graph looks like the following:
```
   1
  / \
 /   \
0 --- 2
     / \
     \_/
```

# Solution

- use bfs algorithm to traverse the graph and get all nodes into a vector
- copy nodes, store the old->new mapping information in a hash map
- copy neighbors(edges)
