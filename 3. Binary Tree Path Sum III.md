# Description

Give a binary tree, and a target number, find all path that the sum of nodes equal to target, the path could be start and end at any node in the tree.

# Solution
- We use two recursion function dfs and find.
- dfs traverse all nodes in the tree, when visit each node, call find to find all paths that the sum of nodes equal to target from this node, then recursively call dfs to traverse its left child and right child. 
- find is used to find all paths from current node to its parent, left child and right child. We add cur's value into path, and update target. If target is equal to 0, it means we find a path that satisfy the requirement, so push this path into ret. Otherwise we try to find current node's parent, left child and right child. Note not to visit node that just visited. At last, update target and path.
