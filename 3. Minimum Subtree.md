# Description

Given a binary tree, find the subtree with minimum sum. Return the root of the subtree.

 Notice

LintCode will print the subtree which root is your return node.
It's guaranteed that there is only one subtree with minimum sum and the given binary tree is not an empty tree.

# Solution

- traverse + divide conquer
- helper is a function that returns sum of a subtree which root is the paremeter p.
- two global variable ret and minsum, ret is the minsum root node, minsum is the minimum sum in this tree.
```
class Solution {
public:
    /*
     * @param root: the root of binary tree
     * @return: the root of the minimum subtree
     */
    TreeNode * ret = NULL;
    int minsum = INT_MAX;
    
    TreeNode * findSubtree(TreeNode * root) {
        // write your code here
        helper(root);
        return ret;
    }
    // return sum of a subtree which root is p
    int helper (TreeNode * p) {
        if (p == NULL)
            return 0;
        int ls = helper(p->left);
        int rs = helper(p->right);
        int sums = ls + rs + p->val;
        if (sums <= minsum) {
            ret = p;
            minsum = sums;
        }
        return sums;
    }
};
```
