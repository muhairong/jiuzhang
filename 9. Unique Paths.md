# Description

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid.

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid.

How many possible unique paths are there?

 Notice

m and n will be at most 100.

# Solution

- dp
- f[i][j] = f[i-1][j] + f[i][j-1];
```
 class Solution {
public:
    /*
     * @param m: positive integer (1 <= m <= 100)
     * @param n: positive integer (1 <= n <= 100)
     * @return: An integer
     */
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        vector<vector<int>> f(m, vector<int>(n, 1));
        for (int i = 1; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j) {
                f[i][j] = f[i-1][j] + f[i][j-1];
            }
        }
        return f[m - 1][n - 1];
    }
};
```
