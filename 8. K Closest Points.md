# Description

Given some points and a point origin in two dimensional space, find k points out of the some points which are nearest to origin.

Return these points sorted by distance, if they are same with distance, sorted by x-axis, otherwise sorted by y-axis.

# Solution

- use a global variable to indicate origin, so we can use it in compare function
- compare is very important
  - usually, priority_queue use less, and let greatest number at top
  - we compare a and b's distance from origin, so we get both distances, and count diff
  - if diff is 0, we compare coordinates
  - we need smallest at top, so return a > b, aka diff > 0
