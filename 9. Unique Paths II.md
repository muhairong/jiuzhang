# Description

Follow up for "Unique Paths":

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.

 Notice

m and n will be at most 100.

# Solution

- note! at first row or column, if you met a obstacle, after this obstacle f are all 0
- note! f[0][0] could be obstacle

```
class Solution {
public:
    /*
     * @param obstacleGrid: A list of lists of integers
     * @return: An integer
     */
    int uniquePathsWithObstacles(vector<vector<int>> &obstacleGrid) {
        int m = obstacleGrid.size();
        int n = obstacleGrid[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> f(m, vector<int>(n, 1));
        int flag = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (obstacleGrid[0][i] == 1 || flag == 1) {
                f[0][i] = 0;
                flag = 1;
            }
        }
        flag = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            if (obstacleGrid[i][0] == 1 || flag == 1) {
                f[i][0] = 0;
                flag = 1;
            }
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j) {
                if (obstacleGrid[i][j] != 1)
                    f[i][j] = f[i - 1][j] + f[i][j - 1];
                else
                    f[i][j] = 0;
            }
        }
        return f[m - 1][n - 1];
    }
